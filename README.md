# better-SEPTA
### Problem Statement : 
The SEPTA transit is a vital public utility that runs on a semi-regular schedule. However, due to unforeseen issues, delays, or malfunctions, the service can be delayed for a considerable amount of time. There is currently no up-to-date information that is readily consumable for the public to gauge when they would like to use SEPTA nor when they should arrive in order to receive optimal service (e.g., catching the correct Trolley that gets one closest to their destination).

### Goal : 
The goal of this repository is to host the source code for a web application designed to create an accessible means for individuals to make informed decisions regarding traveling to their intended destination using SEPTA transit as well as for team collaboration. 

### Roles and Responsibilities :

The contributors and their roles are follows: 

- Derek McCammond : Software Architect 
- Pratik Shekhar : Software Engineer/Developer
- Sam Prasad : Software Engineer/Developer
